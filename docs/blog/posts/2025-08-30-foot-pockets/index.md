I want to build a **short carbon bifin** for pool and training.  
Before cutting any carbon, I need to choose the **foot pocket**. These notes collect what I’ve learned so far.

The main questions:

1. **Which pockets are most commonly used, and why?**
2. **Which ones fit DIY blades without heavy mods?**
3. **How much do blade angle and rails matter for short fins?**
4. **Where can I find solid references?**

<!-- more -->

## 1. Popular models

- **C4** – lightweight, multiple stiffness options
- **Pathos** – 33° angle, minimal rubber for direct power transfer
- **CETMA S-WiNG** – ultralight, no side rails
- **Leaderfins Classic** – integrated rails
- **SEAC** – comfort-oriented
- **Mares Razor / Omer Stingray** – widely available, classic rubber pockets

## 2. DIY blade compatibility

These freediving foot pockets are known to accept third-party or home-made blades:

- Cetma Composites S-WiNG
- Mares Razor
- Pathos
- Capt. Nemo
- Sporasub
- OMER Stingray
- UltraFins

## 3. Angle considerations

- **Blade angle** usually between 20°–33°.
- Larger angles favor surface swimming and gliding, but reduce blade snap.
- Smaller angles (or flat pockets) suit continuous kicking, often better for short fins.

## 4. Rail considerations

- **Rails** stiffen the blade and channel water.
- Long, thick rails can dampen flex and reduce reactivity — especially noticeable on shorter blades.
- **Finding: small rails at the foot pocket let the carbon blade flex and generate thrust more effectively.**
