summary: Bill of materials and layering notes for building a short carbon bifin blade.
---

Now that I’ve mapped out the foot pockets, I want to gather everything I need for actually **building a short carbon bifin blade**.
This is basically my BOM (bill of materials) plus a few notes on layering and finishing.

<!-- more -->

The problems I need to solve here are:
1. Which carbon fabrics and resin to use
2. How to prepare and laminate properly
3. What to use as a support base
4. How many layers are typical for bifins
5. How to finish the blades with rails and glue

## Core Materials

**Carbon cloths (from Easy Composites):**
- [210 g 3k plain weave](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/200g-plain-weave-3k-carbon-fibre-cloth)
- [200 g 3k plain weave](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/200g-plain-weave-3k-carbon-fibre-cloth) (same as above)
- [200 g 3k green twill](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/200g-green-22-twill-3k-carbon-fibre-cloth) — decorative option
- [650 g 12k twill](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/650g-low-cost-22-twill-12k-carbon-fibre-cloth) — heavy, budget-friendly stiffness
- [450 g 12k twill](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/450g-22-twill-12k-carbon-fibre-cloth)
- [300 g 3k biaxial ±45°](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/300g-45-biaxial-carbon-fibre-cloth) — for torsional strength

**Carbon ribbons:**
- [80 g spread-tow ribbon, 15 mm](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/80g-15mm-carbon-fibre-spread-tow-ribbon) — useful for reinforcement strips along rails or centerline.

**Epoxy resin:**
- [EL2 Epoxy Laminating Resin](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/el2-epoxy-laminating-resin)

## Prep and Vacuum

- [Easylease chemical release agent](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/easylease-chemical-release-agent) or [Mould Release Wax](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/number-8-mould-release-wax)
- [Peel Ply](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/peel-ply)
- [Breather Fabric](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/breather-fabric)
- [Vacuum Bagging Film](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/vb160-vacuum-bagging-film) — useful video: [VB160 tutorial](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/vb160-vacuum-bagging-film)

## Support Base

I’ll need a flat sheet to laminate against:

- [Polycarbonate glazing sheet](https://www.diy.com/departments/solstice-solid-polycarbonate-glazing-sheet-clear-610mm-x-457mm-x-4mm/5060938840784_BQ.prd)
- [Wickes Durable Clear Acrylic Sheet](https://www.wickes.co.uk/Wickes-Durable-Clear-Acrylic-Sheet---600-x-1220mm/p/210001)
- [Toolstation polycarbonate sheet](https://www.toolstation.com/solstice-polycarbonate-glazing-sheet-clear/pAA573)

I still need to test which one works best. Acrylic scratches, polycarbonate might flex, but both should be fine for smaller training fins.

## Layering and Sizes

From the references I found:

- **Leaderfins** → 7–8 layers, blade size ~24 cm × 54 cm
- **C4** → 7 layers, but much longer (around 90 cm)
- **DIY YouTube builds** → around 6 layers

For a short training bifin, I’m probably aiming at **6–7 layers**, depending on stiffness.

## Finishing

**Rails:**
- [Waterway fin rails kit](https://www.freedivershop.com/waterway-fin-rails-kit?___store=uk)
- Rail glues mentioned: **Loctite 480** or **3M Marine 5200**
- Good reading on rails: [Spearfishing World thread](https://spearfishing.world/thread/2440-fin-blade-rails-water-channeling-and-tendon-rails-explanation/)

The rails help channel water and also protect the blade edge.

## Where I’m At

For a **short carbon training bifin**, I’ll probably go with:
- ~6–7 layers of 200 g 3k fabric, maybe mixing in a heavier layer (450–650 g) for stiffness
- EL2 epoxy resin
- Laminating on an acrylic/polycarbonate sheet
- Adding rails with Loctite 480 after trimming

This should give me a small, stiff blade that can take some abuse during training without overcomplicating the build.
