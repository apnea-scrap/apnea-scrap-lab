summary: Snapshot of common long and short bifin blade lengths for travel vs. depth training.

I finally pulled together a quick comparison of what "long" and "short" blades actually mean for bifins. Across the usual depth
fin brands there is a pretty clear split between **competition-length blades** and **travel/pool blades**.

<!-- more -->

The tables below track total blade length, the "free" blade that extends past the footpocket, and any extra notes on where the
numbers come from. It's not exhaustive, but it gives a feel for the ranges.

## Quick takeaways

- **Long fins** run about **760–870 mm** total with a **600–720 mm** free blade. These are the depth workhorses.
- **Short fins** are around **550–570 mm** total with a **400–420 mm** free blade. Easy to travel with and great for pool drills.

I'm leaning toward keeping both pairs in rotation: long blades for serious depth days, short blades for technique and pool work
without hauling a massive fin bag around.
