We added a short guide to the measuring vacuum section that covers the **trapped balloon gauge**. The write-up walks through
how to size the container, prep the airflow holes, and use the balloon expansion as a quick visual check that a bag has pulled
down to around 80% of atmospheric pressure.

If you need a reference while setting up a bag, read the new page here: [Trapped Balloon Vacuum Gauge](../../../techniques/measuring-vacuum/v2/trapped-balloon.md).
