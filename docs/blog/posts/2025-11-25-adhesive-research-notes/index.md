After a season of pool and open-water sessions both of our documented rail-gluing approaches — [Two-part Plastic to Carbon Adhesive](../../../techniques/gluing-fin-rails/v1/two-part-plastic-carbon-adhesive.md) and [Marine Adhesive](../../../techniques/gluing-fin-rails/v2/marine-adhesive.md) — started peeling right where the rails meet the foot pocket hardware. That joint sees the most peel stress when the blades flex, and the bond has been letting go in that exact spot.

The quickest fix has been to wick **rubber-toughened cyanoacrylate (CA)** under the lifted sections and clamp for a few minutes. That pinning keeps the rails in place for now, but it is still a patch layered on top of a bond that wants to fail.

## What We Looked At

To break out of the repair cycle we pulled together a set of adhesives that are either already in use or frequently recommended by fin builders. I have not run the hands-on trials yet—the tables below capture what should happen based on spec sheets, shop talk, and how each material usually behaves. The short list:

1. **SC-2000 with hardener** — a chloroprene system made for bonding rubber.
2. **J-B Weld PlasticBonder** — a urethane mix often used for plastic-to-composite joints.
3. **3M 5200** — the marine polyurethane sealant featured in the V2 technique.
4. **Rubber-reinforced CA (Loctite 480 / IC-2000)** — the go-to for fast rail tacking.

## Adhesive Comparison for Bonding Rubber Rails to Carbon Fins

### Table 1 — Adhesives Used by Themselves

| Adhesive | Chemistry | Bond to Carbon | Bond to Rubber | Flexibility | Saltwater Resistance | Ease of Use | Cure Time | Cost (per pair) | Summary Verdict |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **SC-2000 (with hardener)** | Chloroprene (neoprene) vulcanizing adhesive | **Excellent** | **Outstanding** (chemical vulcanization) | High | **Excellent** | Moderate (2-part mix) | ~24 h | ~$3 | Industrial-grade, true rubber–rubber bond; best long-term durability, but messy and overkill for 1–2 fins |
| **J-B Weld PlasticBonder** | 2-part urethane structural adhesive | **Excellent** | Moderate (poor wetting on soft rubbers) | Medium | Very good | Medium | 30 min–24 h | ~$3 | Great for rigid plastics, too stiff for soft rails; better for footpockets or hardware |
| **3M 5200** | 1-part polyurethane sealant | **Excellent** | Poor–moderate | High | **Outstanding** | Easy | 5–7 days | ~$2 | Superb waterproof sealant but weak on TPR/EPDM rails; tends to peel off |
| **Tire Glue (Loctite 480 / IC-2000)** | Rubber-toughened cyanoacrylate | **Excellent** | Moderate (surface-sensitive) | Medium | **Excellent** | Very easy | Seconds | ~$3–5 | Bonds fast and clean but brittle under peel; often detaches from smooth rubber rails |

## Blending in Cyanoacrylate

Adding small beads of CA after seating the rails should change how each primary adhesive behaves. The working idea is to apply the base adhesive, clamp through the cure window, and then wick CA into any exposed seams once the bond sets.

### Table 2 — Effect of Adding CA

| Base Adhesive | Improvement When CA Is Added | Overall Effect ( /10 ) |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **SC-2000** | Much faster setup and stronger edge/peel resistance | **9.5 /10** |
| **PlasticBonder** | Stronger rubber adhesion and instant grip | **9 /10** |
| **Tire Glue** | Better peel resistance and smoother stress distribution | **7.5 /10** |
| **3M 5200** | Slightly faster handling during cure | **3 /10** |

## Takeaways

- **SC-2000 + CA** should land closest to factory rails, though the setup will still be messy and slow.
- **PlasticBonder + CA** looks like a close second and should be easier to portion out for one-off builds.
- **Tire Glue + CA** seems worth keeping in the field kit for quick rail refreshes. The CA backfill should reduce the brittle peel failure we see when CA is used alone.
- **3M 5200 + CA** will likely keep struggling to bite into soft rails. The CA may help with early handling but will not change the long cure or the tendency to peel when the blade flexes.

For now these rankings live in the notebook, and laying them out this way makes it easier to decide which combo deserves the next trial slot once the bench opens up.
