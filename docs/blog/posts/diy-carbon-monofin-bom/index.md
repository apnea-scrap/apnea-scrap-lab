summary: Bill of materials and design notes for building a carbon monofin blade.
---

After mapping out bifins, I want to gather materials and design notes for **building a monofin blade**.
This will be a bit more complex than bifins because monofins need more lateral stability and usually use internal reinforcements.

<!-- more -->

The problems I need to solve are:
1. Which materials carry over from the bifin build
2. What extra elements a monofin blade needs (ribs, edge trims, reinforcements)
3. Typical dimensions of monofins
4. How many layers are used in commercial examples
5. How to finish the blade for durability

## Core Materials

Most of the BOM is the same as the bifins:

- **Carbon cloths** (200–650 g, plain weave, twill, biaxial)
- **Carbon ribbons** (spread-tow strips for reinforcement)
- **EL2 epoxy laminating resin**
- Release agent / mould wax
- Peel ply + breather + vacuum bagging film

---

## Monofin-Specific Materials

- **Rubber U-channel trim** — protects blade edges from chipping
- **Neoprene strips / rubber** — add lateral stiffness and stabilize the blade
- **High-density neoprene sheet** — used in some designs for damping and structural support

These help with **lateral stability**, which is critical in a wide monofin blade.

## Sizes and Dimensions

Some references from commercial monofins:

- **Molchanovs PRO Monofin 4 (Regular):** 72–74 cm length × 70 cm width
- **Molchanovs PRO Monofin 4 (Small):** 70–72 cm length × 68 cm width
- **Cetma Taras Monofin:** max width ~69 cm

So the range seems to be **70–74 cm wide, 68–74 cm long**.

## Layering

From examples I’ve seen:

- **10+ layers** is common for full carbon monofins
- Many use **internal carbon ribs** for stiffness distribution

## Internal and Side Reinforcements

Most high-end monofins use **reinforcement structures**:

- **Internal ribs:** strips of carbon inside the laminate for stiffness
- **Strong side ribs:** thicker rails or carbon laminates that act like wings, resisting side flex
- **Examples:**

## Finishing

- Edge protection: rubber U-channel trim
- Rails (optional, depending on how stable the blade feels)
- Sanded and rounded blade edges for safety and durability

## Where I’m At

Compared to bifins, a DIY monofin clearly needs:
- **More layers (10+)** for stiffness
- **Internal ribs** to control flex and power transfer
- **Side reinforcements** to prevent wobbling
- **Rubber edge trim** for protection

The challenge will be **building internal ribs** into the laminate.  
That’s probably the biggest difference compared to the simpler bifin build.
