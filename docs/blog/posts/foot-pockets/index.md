summary: Collecting references on foot pockets for a short carbon bifin, covering popular models, DIY blade fit, angle and rail considerations, and technical resources.
---

I'm starting a little project: building a **short carbon bifin** for training. Before I even think about layering carbon, I need to figure out which **foot pockets** to use. This post is basically me collecting info and links in one place so I can make a decision later.

The main problems I need to solve are:
1. Which pockets people actually use and why
2. Which ones fit DIY blades
3. How much the angle and rails matter
4. Where to find solid technical references

## Popular models

- **C4** – lightweight pockets available in multiple stiffnesses
- **Pathos** – 33° angle, minimal rubber for direct power transfer
- **CETMA S-WiNG** – ultralight design without side rails
- **Leaderfins Classic** – includes integrated rails
- **SEAC** – known for comfort
- **Mares Razor** and **Omer Stingray** – traditional rubber pockets found on many entry-level fins

## Blade compatibility

These pockets accept a wide range of blades:

- Cetma Composites S-WiNG
- Mares Razor
- Pathos
- Capt. Nemo
- Sporasub
- OMER Stingray
- UltraFins
