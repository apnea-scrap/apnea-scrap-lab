summary: Exploring dedicated monofin foot pockets versus adapted bifin pockets, plus training options and references for DIY builds.
---

This is the second half of my research — this time looking at **monofin foot pockets**.  
Most DIY monofins seem to either use dedicated monofin pockets or just adapt bifin pockets.  
I want to collect the options here to see which direction makes sense for a DIY build.  

The main problems I need to solve are:  
1. What dedicated monofin pockets exist  
2. How bifin pockets get adapted for monofins  
3. Which options make sense for training vs. performance

## Dedicated Monofin Foot Pockets

A couple of manufacturers make pockets specifically for monofins:  

- **[Waterway Monofin Pockets](https://www.waterwayfins.eu/product/monofin-footpockets)**  
  Flat (not angled) design. Old-school style, simple and sturdy.  

- **[CETMA Modular Monofin](https://www.cetmacomposites.it/en/home/2818-blades-for-lotus-monofin.html)**  
  Uses a modular system so blades can be swapped. Also not angled.  

Both are purpose-built for monofins, but the lack of angle might make them feel stiffer and less ergonomic compared to Pathos-style bifin pockets.

## Adapted Bifin Pockets for Monofins

It turns out a lot of commercial monofins just adapt bifin foot pockets:  

- **[Waterway Nemo Wing Monofin](https://www.freedivershop.com/waterway-nemo-wing-monofin)** – looks like standard bifin pockets mounted onto a monofin blade.  
- **[Oceaner Carbon Monofin](https://www.monofinshop.com/product/oceaner-carbon-monofin/)** – same idea, bifin-style pockets glued/attached to a wide blade.  

This approach is appealing for DIY because bifin pockets are easier to source, and I can choose comfort/angle (Pathos, SEAC, Leaderfins, etc.) based on preference.

## Training Monofins

For pool work and technique training, there are monofins built specifically for fast tempo kicking:  

- **[Finis Evo Monofin](https://www.finisswim.eu/Evo-Monofin_2)** – small blade, very quick response, designed for swimming drills.  

Not a traditional freediving monofin, but worth noting as inspiration for a **short, snappy training blade**.

## Where I’m At

Right now I see two directions:  

- **Dedicated monofin pockets** (Waterway, CETMA) → simple but not angled, less ergonomic.  
- **Bifin pockets adapted to monofins** (Waterway Nemo Wing, Oceaner) → more flexibility, and I can pick pockets I already like (Pathos, SEAC, Leaderfins).  

For DIY, the adapted bifin pocket route looks way easier and gives me more control over comfort and angle. That might be the smarter first step before I experiment with dedicated monofin pockets.
