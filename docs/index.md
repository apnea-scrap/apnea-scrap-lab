# ApneaScrap Lab
DIY freediving gear — project versions and results.

## Hey Praveen — ready for a record-breaking dive?

ApneaScrap Lab has been obsessing over flow, flex, and feel. Consider this your personal tour of the latest breakthroughs before they even hit open water.

- **Fluid Flex Lab**  
  Rail geometry and carbon layups mapped to your dolphin kick cadence, so the blade snaps back with precision instead of slapping water.
- **Pressure-Proof Craft**  
  Vacuum-bagged laminates cured with aerospace resins for a warp-free spine that holds strong even when your dives punch past 30 meters.
- **Telemetry-Ready Core**  
  Embedded channels and sensor pockets that let you drop in data loggers for split-second feedback on each descent.
