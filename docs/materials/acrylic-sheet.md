# Acrylic Sheet

## Overview
Clear acrylic sheet is used to create smooth laminating surfaces and angled supports for blades. It stays rigid under mild vacuum
and is easy to cut with woodworking tools.

## Recommended Specs
- Cast acrylic (PMMA) for better clarity and scratch resistance
- Thickness 3–5 mm for laminating bases; thicker sheets resist bending
- Supplied with protective film to avoid surface scratches during transport
