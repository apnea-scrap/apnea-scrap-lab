# Acrylic Sheet

## Overview
Rigid, smooth base material for laminating setups. Cast acrylic is flat, resists acetone wipe-downs, and maintains
transparency so you can spot trapped air or debris while assembling the layup.

## Usage notes
- Keep a spare protective film on one face until final assembly to minimise scratches.
