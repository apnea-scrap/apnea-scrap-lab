# Breather Cloth

## Overview
Breather cloth spreads vacuum pressure evenly and channels air to the resin trap. Polyester felt is reusable for small
projects and easy to cut to shape.

## Usage notes
- Lay the breather so it wraps around the laminate edges to avoid resin-rich corners.
- Store used cloth dry and labelled; light resin stains are fine for secondary layups.
