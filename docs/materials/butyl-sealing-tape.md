# Butyl Sealing Tape

## Overview
Tacky butyl sealant used to close vacuum bags. Sticks well to plastics and peel ply without leaving residue when removed
slowly after the cure.

## Usage notes
- Warm the tape slightly in cold shops so it compresses uniformly.
- Do not stretch during placement; instead, lay it gently and press once the bag is aligned.
