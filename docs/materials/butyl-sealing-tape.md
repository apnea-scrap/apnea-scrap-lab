# Butyl Sealing Tape

## Overview
Butyl sealant tape creates airtight seams between vacuum bag film and tooling surfaces. It must remain tacky throughout the cure
cycle so leaks can be patched quickly.

## Recommended Specs
- 3–4 mm diameter round or rectangular profile
- Compatible with nylon bag film and room-temperature cures
- Non-silicone to avoid contaminating subsequent bonding
