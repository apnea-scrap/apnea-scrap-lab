# Butyl Sealing Tape

## Overview
Tacky butyl sealant used to close vacuum bags. Sticks well to plastics and peel ply without leaving residue when removed
slowly after the cure.

## Purchase history (UK)
| Date | Supplier | Unit price | Notes |

| Jun 2025 | [Easy Composites](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/butyl-sealant-tape) | £5.90 per 15 m roll (12 mm) | Butyl vacuum bag sealant, room-temperature |

## Usage notes
- Warm the tape slightly in cold shops so it compresses uniformly.
- Do not stretch during placement; instead, lay it gently and press once the bag is aligned.
