# Carbon Fiber Fabric

## Overview
Carbon cloth forms the structural backbone of the blades. A 200–240 g/m² 3K twill or plain weave is flexible enough for bifins
while still providing strength. Choose fabric widths that cover the full blade plus trimming allowance.

## Recommended Specs
- 3K 2/2 twill or plain weave carbon cloth
- 200–240 g/m² are versatile weights for fin laminates
- Supplied on the roll to minimise creases; store flat and dry
