# Carbon Fiber Fabric

## Overview
Carbon cloth forms the structural backbone of the blades. A 200–240 g/m² 3K twill or plain weave is flexible enough for
bifins while still providing strength. Choose fabric widths that cover the full blade plus trimming allowance.

## Usage notes
- Roll out on a clean surface and keep the weave under light tension while cutting to avoid distortion.
