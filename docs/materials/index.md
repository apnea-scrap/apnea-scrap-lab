# Materials Directory

A single place to keep track of every consumable, component, or tool that feeds into ApneaScrap Lab builds.
Each page now stores the **purchase history** we have personally recorded so that
techniques can reference a neutral material while still pointing back to real prices.

Only the regions where we hold purchase data are listed. At the moment that means the United Kingdom.
When new data comes in for other locales we can extend each page with additional purchase rows.

## How to contribute

1. Create or update the material page with:
   - a short overview and any usage notes;
   - the `material` front matter block shown below, including at least one purchase entry for every supplier-region pair;
   - a `{{ render_material_purchases() }}` call so the macro can turn the recorded purchases into tables grouped by region.
2. Link techniques and projects to the material page instead of hard-coding suppliers inside a build guide.
3. When logging a new technique version, add a `bill_of_materials` list in the front matter and render it with
   `{{ render_bill_of_materials() }}`. Reference materials via their page path and set `quantity.unit` so the macro can
   match the recorded purchase data automatically. Skip `purchase` hints on technique entriesâ€”the macro infers the
   correct record from the unit you supply. Quantities default to the chosen purchase unit, so you only need to describe
   the amount being used.
