# Materials Directory

A central catalogue of the consumables and components referenced across ApneaScrap Lab.
Each material page explains what to look for, regional supplier options, and which builds use it.

Use this directory to find locally sourced alternatives without the technique pages being tied to one
country or store. When documenting a new technique, link to the relevant material pages instead of listing suppliers directly.

## How to contribute

1. Create or update the material page with a short description, recommended specifications, and any sourcing notes.
2. Group supplier links under regional headings (e.g. United Kingdom, European Union, North America) so readers can quickly spot local options.
3. Add the technique or project that depends on the material to the "Related Techniques" section of the material page.
4. Update the bill of materials in the technique so it links back to the material page.
