# Laminating Epoxy System

## Overview
A balanced resin and hardener system is critical for strong, void-free laminates. Look for low-viscosity epoxies formulated for
hand layup or vacuum bagging, with medium cure speeds that allow adequate working time.

## Recommended Specs
- Mix ratio specified by weight (commonly 100:30 or 100:35)
- Pot life of 20–40 minutes at 20 °C for relaxed layups
- Low viscosity (<600 mPa·s) to wet 3K carbon cloth thoroughly
- Room-temperature cure with option for post-cure if higher Tg is needed
