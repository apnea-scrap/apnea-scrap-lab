# Manual Vacuum Pump

## Overview
Manual pumps are useful for small laminating setups where electric vacuum pumps are overkill. Hand-operated piston or lever
pumps let you evacuate compact vacuum bags while keeping the kit portable.

## Recommended Specs
- Compatible hose barb or valve adapter for storage bags or bagging film
- Capable of reaching at least -0.6 bar on small volumes
- Durable seals that tolerate repeated cycles without oiling
