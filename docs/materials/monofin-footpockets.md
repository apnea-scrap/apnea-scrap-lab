## Overview
Freediving foot pockets lock the blade angle, transfer load through the rails, and define comfort. Look for pockets with
long rails and 20°–33° blade angles when pairing with DIY carbon monofin. Verify screw spacing and slot width so the
pocket seats securely on custom blades.

## Usage notes
- Expect prices to swing widely across suppliers; budget imports can arrive at a third of the retail dealer cost.
- Check for matching left/right pocket sizes when sourcing used or discounted sets.
- Dry-fit the blade to confirm the screws reach the inserts after trimming rails.
