# Peel Ply

## Overview
Breathable nylon layer that wicks away excess resin and leaves a keyed surface for secondary bonding or finishing. Scoured
peel ply releases cleanly from cured laminates.

## Usage notes
- Lay peel ply with light tension to avoid wrinkles imprinting into the laminate.
- Mark up orientation lines on the peel ply to guide blade trimming once cured.
