# PVA Release Agent

## Overview
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) release agents form a sacrificial film that stops epoxy from bonding to tooling surfaces. They are ideal
for sealing laminating bases and moulds that do not have a permanent release coating.

## Recommended Specs
- Water-based PVA formulated for epoxy and polyester systems
- Sprayable or brushable viscosity depending on your tooling finish
- Dries to a thin, even film in under 30 minutes at room temperature
