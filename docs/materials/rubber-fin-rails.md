# Rubber Fin Rails

## Overview
Rubber rails protect blade edges and guide water flow along fins. Choose rails designed for composite freediving blades so they
fit securely while allowing the blade to flex.

## Recommended Specs
- Shore A hardness 60–70 for a balance of grip and flexibility
- Inner profile sized for 2–3 mm blade thickness
- Available in lengths long enough for full blade perimeter (typically 1.6 m per fin)
