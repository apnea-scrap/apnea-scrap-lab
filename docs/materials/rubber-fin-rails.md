# Rubber Fin Rails

## Overview
Rubber side rails improve hydrodynamics and protect blade edges. Choose rails with an internal slot that matches the blade
thickness after finishing.

## Usage notes
- Warm rails in hot water to soften before installation, especially on tight radii.
- Roughen the bonding face lightly with 120-grit sandpaper for better adhesion.
