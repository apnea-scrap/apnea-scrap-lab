# Stackable Plastic Wedges

## Overview
Interlocking plastic shims used to raise and angle the foot pocket section when building modular laminating bases. They are
lightweight, quick to reposition, and resist epoxy drips so they can be reused.

## Usage notes
- Stack wedges under the elevated area in opposing directions so the teeth interlock and prevent creep under load.
