# Vacuum Bag Film

## Overview
Flexible nylon film used to encapsulate laminates during vacuum bagging. The standard Easy Composites film handles room
temperature cures and moderate post-cures.

## Purchase history (UK)
| Date | Supplier | Unit price | Notes |

## Usage notes
- Allow generous slack around the mould so the film can form pleats without bridging.
- Keep offcuts for sealing small repair layups or resin catch pots.
