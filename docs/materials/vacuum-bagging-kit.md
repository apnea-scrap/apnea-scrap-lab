# Vacuum Bagging Kit

## Overview
Budget-friendly bagging setup built from consumer-grade storage bags and a Status hand pump. Effective for small laminate
trials where a full vacuum system would be overkill.

## Components
- **Status manual vacuum pump** – hand-operated pump that pulls a modest vacuum quickly; keep seals lightly greased so it
  stays airtight.
- **Heavy-duty vacuum storage bags** – 55 × 85 cm bags with reliable zip seals; clean the sealing bar before every pull to
  avoid leaks and line the inside with a silicone baking mat to protect the plastic.

## Usage notes
- Expect to re-pump roughly hourly during longer cures; leave the pump attached for quick top-ups.
- Keep both the bag seal and pump interface spotless so grit does not compromise the vacuum.
- For sharper laminates, add a silicone or PTFE liner to stop corners from biting into the bag during evacuation.
