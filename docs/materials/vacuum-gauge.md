# Vacuum Gauge

## Overview
A vacuum gauge helps you monitor seal quality and repeatability. For hand layups, analogue gauges with hose barbs are easy to
install inline with manual pumps or bag valves.

## Recommended Specs
- Range 0 to -1 bar (0 to 30 inHg) with clear markings around -0.2 to -0.8 bar
- 1/4" BSP/NPT or hose barb connection compatible with bag fittings
- Oil-filled gauges resist vibration and make leaks easier to spot
