# Vacuum Storage Bags

## Overview
Household vacuum compression bags can double as low-cost vacuum chambers for small laminates. Choose heavy-duty bags with a valve
that accepts generic pumps and ensure seams can withstand repeated cycles.

## Recommended Specs
- Multi-layer PA/PE film at least 90 microns thick
- Screw-valve compatible with hand pumps or vacuum hoses
- Large enough to fit the laminating base with breather cloth clearance
