# Projects

Explore every build we are documenting in the lab. Each project index collects the current version notes, BOM, and testing logs so you can replicate or remix the work.

## Short fins
- [Short fins versions](short-fins/index.md): laminated blades tuned for pool dynamics with compress layups and flex measurements.

## Neck weight
- [Neck weight versions](neck-weight/index.md): modular ballast systems with molded sleeves and quick-adjust ballast pods.

## Future gear
