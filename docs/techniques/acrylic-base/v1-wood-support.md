# Acrylic base - V1 — wood support

25° wooden base with acrylic sheets for laminating carbon fin blades.

## Problem
Laminating **carbon fin blades** requires a surface that matches blade geometry. The blade has a flat footpocket connection and an angled active area (about 20–30°). A flat surface can't reproduce this transition.

## Solution
An **acrylic laminating surface** sits on a **wooden angled base**.

- **Base construction**: side supports cut at **25°** and fixed with **metal brackets** for a rigid incline.
- **Laminating surface**: acrylic sheets taped down with **double-sided tape**, creating a smooth, replaceable platform.

## Materials
- Wooden board (base)
- Wooden side supports cut at 25°
- Metal brackets with screws
- Acrylic sheets sized to the vacuum bag
- Double-sided tape

## Tools
- Saw
- Drill and screwdriver
- Measuring tools (square, protractor, tape measure)
- Sandpaper

## Time Required
- Cutting and assembling wooden support: **1–2 hours**
- Preparing and mounting acrylic sheet: **15–30 minutes**
- **Total build time**: **1.5–2.5 hours**

## Trade-offs
- Wooden support adds cutting, fitting, and bracket installation.
- Entire base must fit inside the vacuum bag.
- Gap between angled section and support can trap air and bend the acrylic during bagging.
