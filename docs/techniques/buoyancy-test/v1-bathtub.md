# Buoyancy test v1 — bathtub
{{ status_banner() }}
Basic procedure for checking buoyancy using a pool or bathtub test.

## Goal
Estimate whether a fin is positively, neutrally, or negatively buoyant.

## Specifications / Dimensions
- Any container deep enough to fully submerge the fin (bathtub, pool, etc.).

## Materials / Bill of Materials
- Fin to be tested
- Small weights (e.g., dive weights)
- Water container

## Tools Required
- Scale for measuring added weight
- Towel for drying equipment

## Instructions (step-by-step)
1. Fill the container with enough water to submerge the fin.
2. Place the fin in the water and observe if it floats or sinks.
3. If the fin floats, gradually add weight until it barely submerges.
4. Record the total weight required for neutral buoyancy.

## Data to Record / Results
- Weight needed to sink the fin
- Qualitative observation: floats, sinks, or neutral

## Tips, Trade-offs, or Limitations
- Test in still water to avoid false readings from currents.
- For greater accuracy, repeat the measurement several times and average the results.
