# Carbon layup v1 — wet layup
{{ status_banner() }}

Baseline recipe with 0/90 twill and simple taper.

## Goal
Produce a basic carbon blade using a manual wet layup.

## Specifications / Dimensions
- Uses 0/90 3K twill carbon cloth
- Geometry and taper follow the chosen cutting template

## Materials / Bill of Materials

### From Easy Composites:
1. **Laminating Starting Kit**:
    - **0.3 sqm** 2/2 Twill 3K Carbon Fiber Cloth
    - **154g EL2 laminating epoxy resin**
    - **46g AT30 Fast epoxy hardener** (mix 100:30 by weight with the resin)
    - **35ml PVA mold release agent**
    - **0.3 sqm Peel Ply**
    - **3 pairs nitrile gloves, 3 mixing pots, 3 mixing sticks**
    - **1-inch laminating brush**
    - **2 x 0.5-inch laminating brushes**

2. **Plastic Finned Roller with Handle**: 75mm roller

### From Amazon:
- **Amazon Basics Vacuum Compression Zipper Storage Bags** (with airtight valve) and **hand pump** (optional, for vacuum pressing).

### From DIY Stores:
- **Acetone**: For cleaning the brushes after use.

### Additional Tool Required:
- **Digital Scale**: Accurate mixing of resin and hardener.

## Tools Required
- Nitrile gloves
- Mixing pots and sticks
- Laminating brushes
- Plastic finned roller (75 mm)
- Scissors for cutting fabric
- Digital scale
- Optional: vacuum storage bags and hand pump

## Instructions (step-by-step)

### **0. Safety First**
- Wear **nitrile gloves** and work in a **well-ventilated area** to avoid exposure to harmful fumes.

---

### **1. Prepare the Work Surface**
1. Pour a small amount of the **PVA mold release agent** into a cup.
2. Using a **brush**, apply the release agent **thinly and evenly** over the working surface or mold.
    - Tip: Refer to this **[video at 2:00](https://youtu.be/neh6zDt7vD8?si=0ocFH4VtYBHPhHzH)** for guidance.

---

### **2. Cut the Carbon Fiber Cloth**
- Measure and cut the **carbon fiber cloth** to desired dimensions.
- Ensure smooth cuts to maintain structural strength along the fiber weave.

---

### **3. Prepare the Epoxy Resin**
1. Pour **epoxy resin** into a mixing pot.
    - Use a **ratio of 100:30 by weight** (resin:hardener) for mixing.
    - Example: For **100g of resin**, add **30g of hardener**.

2. Use the **digital scale** for precise measurement.
3. Mix the resin and hardener thoroughly, but **gently**, to avoid introducing air bubbles.

---

### **4. Lay the Resin and Carbon Cloth**
1. Begin by spreading an even layer of **resin** directly onto the prepared mold or surface.
2. Lay the **carbon fiber cloth** over the resin layer.
3. Apply another layer of resin over the cloth using the **brush** and smooth it out with the **roller**.
    - Tip: Use the roller to eliminate any trapped air and ensure the **cloth adheres evenly**.

---

### **5. Apply Peel Ply**
1. Once the laminate layers are complete, apply **two layers of peel ply** over the top surface.
    - Peel ply absorbs **excess resin** and ensures a uniform finish.

2. Optionally, you can include a **breather layer** to improve vacuum results (future upgrade).

3. (Optional) If using vacuum storage bags, place the prepared laminate inside, seal, and apply **vacuum pressure** using the pump.

---

### **6. Clean-Up**
1. Clean all reusable tools (e.g., brushes) with **acetone** immediately after use.
2. Discard **used gloves, cups, and mixing sticks** responsibly.

## Data to Record / Results
- Resin and hardener weights mixed
- Total laminate weight after cure
- Observations on air bubbles or dry spots

## Tips, Trade-offs, or Limitations
- Manual layup can trap more resin compared to vacuum infusion.
- Work time is limited once resin is mixed; prepare all materials in advance.
