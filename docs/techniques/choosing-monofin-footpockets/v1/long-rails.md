## Goal
Choose the right freediving foot pockets for DIY monofin, focusing on performance-critical features.

## Specifications / Dimensions
- Foot pocket rails: **long** to transfer more power from the footpockets to the monofin blade
- Blade angle: **20°–33°** for better body position and surface gliding
- Attachment system: screws for secure hold

## Instructions (step-by-step)

1. **Check rail length**

    - Choose pockets with stiff **long rails** so that we transfer more energy to the blade.
    - The rails only touch the stiff upper part while allowing the lower part of the blade to flex
    - Review current supplier pricing on the [monofin foot pockets material page](../../../materials/monofin-footpockets.md) — budget listings can differ from retail stock.

2. **Check blade angle**

    - Select pockets with **20°–33° blade angle**.
    - Larger angles favor surface swimming and gliding.
    - Smaller angles or flat pockets may feel more responsive but are less efficient for pool or surface work.

3. **Check attachment system**

    - Ensure the pockets use a screws attachment system
    - This system is standard for modern freediving pockets and ensures a secure, repeatable fit.
