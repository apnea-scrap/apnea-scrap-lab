# Cutting Cured Carbon v1 — Junior Hacksaw
{{ status_banner() }}

## Goal
To cut cured carbon laminate into the desired shape using a simple junior hacksaw method, ensuring a clean fit into the final assembly.

## Materials / Bill of Materials
- Printed or drawn cutting template
- Electrical tape (to attach the template to the laminate)

## Tools Required
- Junior hacksaw with a fine-tooth metal blade
- Metal file
- Safety goggles, dust mask, and protective gloves

## Instructions (step-by-step)
0. **Safety**: Wear gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask. Perform all steps in a well-ventilated area.
1. Attach the cutting template to the cured laminate using electrical tape.
2. Hold the laminate securely on a stable surface.
3. Use a junior hacksaw with a fine-tooth metal blade to slowly cut along the template line. Apply steady pressure and avoid forcing the saw.
4. Once the piece is cut, smooth the edges with a metal file.
5. Test the fit by inserting the blade into the foot pocket.
6. If it does not fit properly, continue filing the edges gradually until the correct fit is achieved.

## Limitations
- Sawing generates dust and small splinters — PPE is required
- Cutting is slow and requires quite some effort, depending on how thick the laminate is
