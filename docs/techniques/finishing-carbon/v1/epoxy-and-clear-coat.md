## Goal

To apply a protective and aesthetic finish to cured carbon blades by sealing, smoothing, and clear-coating the surface.  
This improves durability, protects against moisture, enhances gloss, and provides the option for custom decals.

## Bill of Materials

{{ render_bill_of_materials() }}

## Tools Required

- Mixing cups (for resin + hardener)
- Small brush (for epoxy layer)
- Sandpaper (400 / 600 grit; 1000 grit optional for higher gloss)
- Gloves
- Eye protection
- Well-ventilated workspace

## Instructions (step-by-step)

0. **Safety**
    - Wear gloves and eye protection.
    - Work in a well-ventilated area.

1. **Resin Finishing Layer**
    - Mix resin and hardener as usual.
    - Apply a thin finishing coat with a brush over the cured carbon surface.
    - Smooth out imperfections.
    - Allow resin to fully cure.
    - Clean the brush immediately after use.

2. **Optional Sanding**
    - If a smoother or glossier surface is desired, sand the cured resin lightly.
    - Start with 400 grit, then move to 600 grit.
    - Finish with 1000 grit if you want a mirror-like polish.
    - Skip this step if surface smoothness is not critical.

3. **Optional Decal Application**
    - Print the logo onto the **back** of vinyl sticker paper. [Download the printable logo](logo_for_fins_on_graph_paper_mirrored.png)

     - Cut out the design.
    - Apply the decal carefully onto the carbon surface.

4. **Clear Coat**
    - Spray the entire surface with acrylic clear coat.
    - Apply 3 light, even layers.
    - Allow proper drying time between layers.

## Limitations

- Requires time and patience for curing and sanding.
- Gloss finish depends on sanding quality and spray application.
