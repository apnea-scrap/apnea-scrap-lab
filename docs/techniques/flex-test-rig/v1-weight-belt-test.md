# Flex test rig v1: weight belt test

**Goal**
Measure how much load makes the **tip vertical (90°)** and where the blade bends (root, mid, tip).

---

## Setup
- **Clamp**: Fix the blade root flat with ≈80 mm clamped depth. Use rubber pads to protect and prevent slip.
- **Span**: Measure blade length `L` from clamp line to tip.
- **Marks**: Put dots on one edge at:
  - Root zone ≈ `0.3 L`
  - Mid zone ≈ `0.6 L`
  - Tip zone ≈ `0.9 L`
- **Weight belt loading**:
  - Wrap a weight belt snugly around the blade.
  - Place dive weights **on top** of the blade at the **tip (L)** and **mid zone (0.6 L)**.
  - Keep a **2:1 ratio** — twice as much load at the tip as at the mid.
  - Ensure weights are centered so they press straight down, not on the rails.
- **Camera**: Place a phone side-on, level with blade mid-height.
- **Reference**: Tape a ruler or printed grid behind the blade.

## Step 1 — Load until tip is vertical
1. Add weights to tip and mid (2:1 ratio).
2. After each step, check the **tip angle** with an angle finder or from the side photo.
3. Stop when the last 20 mm of the tip points straight down (≈90°).
4. Record total weight used (belt + dive weights).
