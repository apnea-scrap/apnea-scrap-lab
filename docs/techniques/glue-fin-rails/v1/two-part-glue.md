# Glue fin rails v1 — polyurethane adhesive
{{ status_banner() }}
Rubber rails, light clamp pressure, full cure overnight.

## Goal
Bond rubber rails to the blade edges using polyurethane adhesive.

## Specifications / Dimensions
- Rails sized to match blade length and thickness

## Materials / Bill of Materials
- Rubber fin rails
- Polyurethane adhesive
- Masking tape or clamps
- Cleaning solvent (e.g., acetone)

## Tools Required
- Scissors or knife to trim rails
- Applicator stick or nozzle for adhesive
- Clamps or tape to hold rails while curing
- Gloves

## Instructions (step-by-step)
1. Clean blade edges with solvent and let dry.
2. Apply a thin bead of polyurethane adhesive along each edge.
3. Press rails onto the adhesive, aligning carefully.
4. Hold in place with light clamp pressure or masking tape.
5. Allow to cure fully (overnight recommended).

## Limitations
- Any gaps, even small ones, can expand over time and potentially cause the entire rail to detach
