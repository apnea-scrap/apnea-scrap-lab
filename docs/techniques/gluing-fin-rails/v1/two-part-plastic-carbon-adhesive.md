## Goal

To attach rubber fin rails securely to carbon fiber blades using a strong composite adhesive.  
The rails protect the blade edges, improve water flow, and extend the blade’s lifespan.

## Instructions (step-by-step)

0. **Safety**
      - Wear gloves to avoid skin contact with adhesive.
      - Work in a ventilated space.

1. **Surface Preparation**
      - Sand the edge of the carbon blade lightly with 400-grit sandpaper.
      - Sand the inside surface of the rubber fin rail to improve adhesion.
      - Clean both the blade edge and the inside of the rail with window cleaner.

2. **Apply Adhesive**
      - Mix the two-part adhesive according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
      - Apply the adhesive generously inside the fin rail.
      - Press the rail firmly onto the blade edge, ensuring full contact along the surface.
      - Check carefully for gaps — even small gaps can expand over time and risk detachment.

3. **Remove Excess Adhesive**
      - Wipe off any excess adhesive that squeezes out during pressing.

4. **Clamp the Rails**
      - Secure the rails in place using fold-back paper clips spaced evenly along the edge.

5. **Curing**
      - Allow the adhesive to cure fully according to the manufacturer’s specifications (usually around 12 hours).

## Limitations

- Poor surface preparation (e.g., not sanding both blade edge and rail interior) may result in weak bonding.
- Adhesive application must be uniform; gaps reduce durability and may lead to rail detachment over time.
