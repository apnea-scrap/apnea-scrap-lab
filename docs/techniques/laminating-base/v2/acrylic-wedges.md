# Laminating Base - V2 - Acrylic with Wedge Supports

This document describes how to build a modular acrylic base with wedge supports for laminating carbon fins.  
The example shown is for a **70 × 70 cm monofin**, but the same technique can be adapted for **bifins** or other blade sizes.

## Base Dimensions
- **Target working area (monofin example):** ~80 × 90 cm  
- **Purpose:** Provides enough surface for a 70 × 70 cm monofin blade plus sealing margin  
- **Support requirement:** Must be placed on a **flat, rigid surface** such as a table or workbench  
- **Protection:** Place a **plastic sheet** under the base to protect the table surface  

## Materials
- **6 × A3 acrylic sheets (2 mm thick)**  
  - 4 sheets for the flat blade section (2 wide × 2 tall)  
  - 2 sheets for the angled footpocket section  
- **Electrical tape** for sealing the joints  
- **Plastic stackable wedges** to create the angled section under the footpockets  
- **Protective plastic sheet** (to cover the table surface beneath the acrylic)  

## Tools
- Isopropyl alcohol and cloth (for cleaning sheet edges)  
- Scissors or knife (for trimming electrical tape)  
- Measuring tape or ruler (for alignment)  
- Squeegee, roller, or thumb pressure (for pressing tape flush)  

## Time Required
- **Base assembly:** ~30 minutes  
- **Wedge placement & alignment:** ~10 minutes  

## Assembly (Monofin Example)
1. **Prepare the surface**  
   - Place a plastic sheet on a flat, rigid table or bench.  
   - Ensure there is no dust or debris under the plastic.  

2. **Arrange acrylic sheets**  
   - Flat blade section: 4 A3 sheets in a 2 × 2 layout (~59 × 84 cm).  
   - Footpocket section: 2 A3 sheets side by side (~29.7 × 84 cm).  

3. **Join sheets**  
   - Clean edges with isopropyl alcohol.  
   - Bridge each joint with electrical tape, overlapping slightly (1–2 mm).  
   - Press tape firmly to remove trapped air and keep surface flush.  

4. **Add wedge supports**  
   - Place plastic stackable wedges under the footpocket section.  
   - Adjust wedge height to set the required angle (typically 20–30° for a monofin).
   - Ensure wedges are stable and evenly distributed.  

## Tradeoffs
- **Advantage:** This version does not require a heavy wooden support structure, making it much easier and faster to put together.  
- **Advantage:** Modular design — acrylic sheets and wedges can be stored flat and reused for different versions.  
- **Drawback:** The base cannot be placed as a whole into a vacuum bag.  
- **Drawback:** The only viable vacuum method is sealing the edges of the bag around the acrylic surface, which is less flexible than a solid one-piece base.  

## Adaptation for Bifins
- Use the same base principle: flat section + small angled section for the footpockets.  
- Fewer acrylic sheets are needed since bifin blades are narrower.  
- For bifins around **20–22 cm wide per blade**, two A3 sheets side by side are often enough for the flat section.
