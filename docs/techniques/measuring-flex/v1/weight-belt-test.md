## Goal
Measure the load required to make the **tip vertical (90°)** and observe where the blade bends (root, mid, tip).

## Specifications / Dimensions
- Clamp depth ≈80 mm on the blade root
- Marks at 0.3 L (root), 0.6 L (mid), and 0.9 L (tip)
- Weights applied in a 2:1 ratio (tip:mid)

## Materials
- Weight belt
- Dive weights
- Ruler or printed grid
- Tape for securing the reference grid

## Tools Required
- Clamp with rubber pads
- Camera or smartphone
- Angle finder or protractor

## Instructions
- **Step 1 — Load until tip is vertical**  
  Add weights to tip and mid (2:1 ratio) and stop when the last 20 mm of the tip points straight (≈90°). Record the total weight.

  Formula:  
  `F90 = m × 9.81 (N)`

- **Step 2 — Measure bend at 3 zones**  
  Take a side photo at the load and estimate local slope (angle) at each zone:
  - `θ_root` at 0.3 L
  - `θ_mid` at 0.6 L
  - `θ_tip` at 0.9 L

## Data to Record
- Clamp depth (mm)
- Blade span L (mm)
- Load method: belt with weights on top (tip + mid, 2:1 ratio)
- **F90** (N)
- **θ_root, θ_mid, θ_tip** (degrees at F90)

## Limitations
- Dive weights limit fine-tuning of the scale
