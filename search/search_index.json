After that the blade just folds over, stalls, and stops storing energy. Most long fins (XT Diving, C4, Leaderfins, etc.) fall in the 80\u201390 cm length range, so that\u2019s the baseline for comparing these values.</p> <p>The nuance: fins that bend closer to the footpocket always feel softer\u2014even if the tip load matches a \u201charder\u201d blade. When the flex starts near your feet the blade unloads early, the water sheds faster, and the kick feels lighter.
