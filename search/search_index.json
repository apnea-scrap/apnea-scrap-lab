Safety First - Wear nitrile gloves and work in a well-ventilated area to avoid exposure to harmful fumes.</p> <p>1. Prepare the Work Surface 1. Pour a small amount of the PVA mold release agent into a cup. 2. Using a brush, apply the release agent thinly and evenly over the working surface or mold.    - Tip: Refer to this video at 2:00 for guidance.</p> <p>2. Cut the Carbon Fiber Cloth - Measure and cut the carbon fiber cloth to desired dimensions. - Ensure smooth cuts to maintain structural strength along the fiber weave.</p> <p>3. Prepare the Epoxy Resin 1. Pour epoxy resin into a mixing pot.    - Use a ratio of 100:30 by weight (resin:hardener) for mixing.    - Example: For 100g of resin, add 30g of hardener.</p> <ol> <li>Use the digital scale for precise measurement.</li> <li>Mix the resin and hardener thoroughly, but gently, to avoid introducing air bubbles.</li> </ol> <p>4. Lay the Resin and Carbon Cloth 1. Begin by spreading an even layer of resin directly onto the prepared mold or surface. 2. Lay the carbon fiber cloth over the resin layer. 3. Apply another layer of resin over the cloth using the brush and smooth it out with the roller.    - Tip: Use the roller to eliminate any trapped air and ensure the cloth adheres evenly.</p> <p>5. Apply Peel Ply 1. Once the laminate layers are complete, apply two layers of peel ply over the top surface.    - Peel ply absorbs excess resin and ensures a uniform finish.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Optionally, you can include a breather layer to improve vacuum results (future upgrade).</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) If using vacuum storage bags, place the prepared laminate inside, seal, and apply vacuum pressure using the pump.</p> </li> </ol> <p>6.
